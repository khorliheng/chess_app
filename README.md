# 🧠 Chess Game with Stockfish AI – Customized by Henry Khor

This project is a customized version of the original [Chess Game](https://github.com/awsomeCStutorials/chess-game) developed by awsomeCStutorials. It serves as a learning platform to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript, and AI integration in web applications.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The application offers two primary modes:

- **Player vs. Player**: Play against a friend in the same browser.
- **Player vs. AI**: Challenge the computer powered by the Stockfish chess engine via a REST API.
