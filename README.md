# üß† Chess Game with Stockfish AI ‚Äì Customized by Henry Khor

This project is a customized version of the original [Chess Game](https://github.com/awsomeCStutorials/chess-game) developed by awsomeCStutorials. It serves as a learning platform to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript, and AI integration in web applications.

## üéØ Project Overview

The application offers two primary modes:

- **Player vs. Player**: Play against a friend in the same browser.
- **Player vs. AI**: Challenge the computer powered by the Stockfish chess engine via a REST API.

- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, HTML, SCSS
- **Chess Engine**: [Stockfish REST API](https://stockfish.online/)
- **Assets**: Chess piece images sourced from [Lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org)

As part of my learning journey, I plan to implement the following enhancements:

- **User Interface Improvements**: Revamp the UI for better user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is mobile-friendly.
- **Game Features**:
  - Implement move history and undo functionality.
  - Add player timers and score tracking.
